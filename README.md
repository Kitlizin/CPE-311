# CPE-311
My full name is Keith Leigh Zhen Marquez, but you can call me “Keh” for short. Currently in my 2nd year of BSCPE, I'm 18 years old and was born on July 31, 2004, making me a Leo. I have a particular fondness for Carbonara—it's my favorite food. In life, I live by the motto that success is impossible without sacrifice. Late submissions evoke tears in me, and if I were to choose one word to describe myself, it would be ambitious. As for happiness, I believe it stems from loving oneself.
