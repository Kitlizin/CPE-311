# CPE-311
My full name is Keith Leigh Zhen Marquez, but you can call me “Keh” for short. ✨ Currently in my 2nd year of BSCPE, I'm 19 years old and was born on July 31, 2004, making me a Leo. 🦁 I have a particular fondness for Carbonara—it's my favorite food. 🍝 In life, I live by the motto that success is impossible without sacrifice. 💪 Late submissions evoke tears in me, 😢 and if I were to choose one word to describe myself, it would be ambitious. 🚀 As for happiness, I believe it stems from loving oneself. 💖 Future Pilot-Engineer ✈️👨‍🔧
